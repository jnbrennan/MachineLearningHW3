Using various classifiers on Iris dataset

In this assignment, I used the well known Iris dataset and tried to predict the flower species based off of the petal length and petal width. 

In HW3-1, I used logistic regression to make the species prediction. I used the defauly classifier parameters as the assignment specified.

In HW3-2, I used logistic regression again, but tweaked the C and random_state parameters. 

In HW3-3, I used the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to make the species prediction and played around with the k value.
